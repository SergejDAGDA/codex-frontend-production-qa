# Frontend Production QA

[Русская версия](README.ru.md)

A reusable Codex plugin for production-grade frontend implementation and QA.

It does not replace specialist skills. It orchestrates them, defines how deeply a browser-facing change must be verified, and decides when the work has enough evidence to be considered complete.

## Why this exists

A frontend change can compile and still be wrong:

- a desktop fix breaks mobile;
- one screenshot looks right while another viewport overflows;
- a shared component regresses on another route;
- screenshots are generated but never inspected;
- a visual baseline is updated instead of fixing the regression;
- a plugin appears installed while the expected skill payload is unavailable.

`frontend-production-qa` adds an evidence-based completion workflow around those failure modes.

## Install from GitHub

The GitHub repository is the canonical source. Do not maintain a separate manual copy of this skill when using the plugin distribution.

```powershell
codex plugin marketplace add SergejDAGDA/codex-frontend-production-qa --ref main
codex plugin add frontend-production-qa@codex-frontend-production-qa
```

Start a fresh Codex session after installation.

### Update from GitHub

```powershell
codex plugin marketplace upgrade codex-frontend-production-qa
codex plugin add frontend-production-qa@codex-frontend-production-qa
```

Then start a fresh Codex session.

The second command is intentionally safe to repeat and ensures the installed plugin payload is materialized from the refreshed marketplace snapshot.

### One source of version truth

The public plugin version lives only in:

```text
plugin.json
```

Do not add separate release versions to `SKILL.md` or dependency manifests.

Every published plugin change must bump the manifest version. This prevents a new Git snapshot from being mistaken for an already-cached payload with the same version.

### Migrating from the old manual install

If `frontend-production-qa` was previously copied to:

```text
~/.agents/skills/frontend-production-qa/
```

remove or rename that old manual copy before using the plugin install. Codex does not merge skills with the same `name`; duplicate copies can both appear.

## Bundled Inspo MCP

The plugin bundles the hosted [Inspo](https://github.com/Nutlope/inspo) MCP endpoint:

```text
https://inspomcp.dev/api/mcp
```

Inspo provides searchable references from real production websites. The orchestrator uses it selectively for:

- new UI;
- new components;
- substantial redesigns;
- visual-direction exploration;
- hierarchy/layout exploration;
- explicit requests for references or inspiration.

It is not the design authority for an existing project. For bug fixes, screenshot matching, responsive regressions, or work that must preserve an established visual language, the project itself remains the source of truth.

No separate `codex mcp add inspo ...` is needed when the plugin is installed.

## Core workflow

```text
project rules
  -> understand/reproduce
  -> optional design references when warranted
  -> frontend implementation
  -> design-quality layer when relevant
  -> code checks
  -> real browser
  -> responsive verification
  -> rendered visual QA
  -> regression closure
  -> conditional review/security/performance/release gates
  -> completion evidence
```

## Verification classes

| Class | Typical change | Required verification |
|---|---|---|
| A | layout, responsive, typography wrapping, shared UI, navigation, release prep | real browser + full 8-viewport matrix + visual QA + regression closure |
| B | small visual change with no plausible geometry impact | real browser + reduced 3-viewport matrix + visual inspection |
| C | nonvisual browser-facing change | targeted browser verification |
| D | backend/non-UI | no frontend workflow unless rendered browser behavior changes |

1920x1080
```

Reduced matrix:

```text
390x844
768x1024
1440x900
```

If breakpoint `B` changes or is suspected, also test `B-1`, `B`, and `B+1`.

## Required specialist stack

The workflow expects:

- `frontend-ui-engineering`
- `browser-testing-with-devtools`
- `frontend-visual-qa`
- Chrome DevTools MCP

The first two come from [addyosmani/agent-skills](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills).

`frontend-visual-qa` is bundled in this repository. Its original upstream source is [daymade/claude-code-skills](https://github.com/daymade/claude-code-skills), but the maintained Codex-adapted copy here is the version used by this plugin.

Chrome DevTools MCP comes from [ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp).

Recommended design-quality layer:

- [Impeccable](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable)

Related optional skills:

- `ui-designer`
- `qa-expert`

Optional existing integrations:

- `taste-skill`
- `karpathy-guidelines`
- `context-engineering`
- `maintain-project-memory`

The orchestrator does not install or update optional integrations.

## Project routing

Do not copy the whole skill into a project's `AGENTS.md`.

Use the short routing fragment:

```text
skills/frontend-production-qa/assets/AGENTS.frontend.fragment.md
```

Project-specific architecture, legal constraints, design decisions and memory remain authoritative in the project itself.

## Dependency maintenance

The plugin itself is updated through the Git-backed marketplace.

The maintenance scripts inside the skill are only for the external specialist toolchain:

```powershell
.\scripts\check-frontend-toolchain.ps1
.\scripts\bootstrap-frontend-toolchain.ps1
.\scripts\check-frontend-updates.ps1
.\scripts\update-frontend-toolchain.ps1 -Apply
```

Normal frontend work must not silently install or update third-party dependencies.

See:

- [Dependencies](skills/frontend-production-qa/references/dependencies.md)
- [Verification matrix](skills/frontend-production-qa/references/verification-matrix.md)
- [Toolchain maintenance](skills/frontend-production-qa/references/toolchain-maintenance.md)

## Central completion rule

Any later CSS/layout/spacing/typography/positioning/sizing/visibility/breakpoint/shared-style change invalidates the previous visual verification for the affected surface.

Re-run the applicable browser and responsive checks after the fix.

Do not report `done`, `fixed`, or `ready` when required verification is incomplete.
